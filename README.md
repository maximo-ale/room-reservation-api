# Reservation System REST API
A fully functional Reservation System REST API built with Node.js, TypeScript, Express, and PostgreSQL.  
It includes authentication, role-based access control, resource management, reservation handling, availability checks, statistics, error handling, and testing.

---

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
- git clone https://github.com/maximo-ale/room-reservation-api.git
- cd room-reservation-api

2. Install dependencies
- npm install

3. Copy '.env.example' to '.env'
- On Windows CMD:
copy .env.example .env
- On Windows PowerShell:
Copy-Item .env.example .env
- On Linux/macOS:
cp .env.example .env

4. The '.env' file already includes a test user and a public database

4. Start the server
- npm run dev

## Database Reset for Demo

This project includes a script to reset the database and load test data automatically when the server starts with:

RESET_DB_ON_START=true

Notes:

Only for demo/testing purposes.

It is disabled by default (RESET_DB_ON_START=false) in production to preserve real data.

This ensures each recruiter or tester starts with a clean environment.
